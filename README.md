# Multicalss-TB
Integrating unsupervised and supervised learning for automated diagnosis of tuberculosis.

This was part of my master's research project at Indian  Institute of Technology(BHU), varanasi, where I aim to compare the performance of Multi-class classifier over binary classifier on MODS dataset of TB disease on a seven layer deep CNN.The binary data of positive and negative images was clustered into optimum classes using K-means clustering algorithm.Google colab's GPU was used to train and hypertune the model.

## Add this
- Introduce the base model
- Results of the base model (8% failure rate which is very in medical field)
- Explain your changes done on that like made multiclass instead of binary class
- How to run
- Comparison of results at same number of layers with the base model
- Future work
