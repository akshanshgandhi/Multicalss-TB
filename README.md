Integrating unsupervised and supervised learning for automated diagnosis of tuberculosis.

This was part of my master's research project at Indian  Institute of Technology(BHU), varanasi, where I aim to compare the performance of Multi-class classifier over binary classifier on MODS dataset of TB disease on a seven layer deep CNN.The binary data of positive and negative images was clustered into optimum classes using K-means clustering algorithm.Google colab's GPU was used to train and hypertune the model.
